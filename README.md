Hello this Github is for primarily storing the Parts to make Mine Little Pony Skins for MCA

Including Bald Bases, Manes and Tails and finally Eyes. The bases and hair come in white/grey to easily recolor/Lay color ontop for MCA

Ideally Build the Skins in THIS ORDER ->Skin ->Eyes ->Mane and Tails

Some of the skin parts are made by me and the others are pulled from https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Community-Skin-Pack/tree/master

Please be sure to thank the team from the github above as well if you use these skins for anything as we wouldnt be here without them! :) 
Please do note there are more Unicorn skins due to the Magic Color pixel change
